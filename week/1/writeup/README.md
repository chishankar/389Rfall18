### Part 2 (75 pts)

#### Who should you tell, if anybody?
I would tell my boss first, consumer watchdog second, and the public last. I would first tell my boss as he would have the power to do something about it, whether it’s putting together a team to resolve the issue or working it into next sprint or doing an official public announcement. Second I would go to a consumer watchdog that watches out for the public interests because it would be important that they tell the people that it effects. And lastly I would then tell the public after if the first and/or second option does not work.

If the company is not willing to postpone the ECU’s release, they are endangering the lives of many others by incorporating something that has a known vulnerability. I would try and get a lawyer or a car inspector to take a look at it and see if they can renegotiate with the company on more serious terms where they can threaten to shut the whole operation down. After that, I would tell consumer watchdogs and my friends and then leave the company as I don’t want anything to do with a company that doesn’t care about it’s audience.

If I do nothing, I would be responsible for the harm and the results that the vulnerability can lead do. I knowingly participated and helped to develop something that is faulty. Everyone who knew about the vulnerability, but did nothing about it is at fault.
